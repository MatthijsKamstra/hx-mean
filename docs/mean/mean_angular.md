# ME(A)N

The original MEAN stack was with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

I have really no interests in Angular.
So check out the [templating](../templates/index.md) chapter.

## Haxe Externs

It looks like there are some attempts for Haxe externs, but they are between 3 and 4 years old

- https://github.com/blackjyn/Angular2-Haxe
- https://github.com/kmshi/haxejs-angular
- https://github.com/frabbit/angular.haxe

Use if you want to, but I am not going to work with Angular anyway.
